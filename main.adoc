Currying In The Wild
====================
// :author: Deon Tan


Introduction
------------
- 'Currying' <- weird word!
- Actually named after Haskell Curry (Mathematician known for combinatory logic)

Lambda vs. Machine
------------------
- Brief history lesson about Functional Programming

Lambda vs. Machine
------------------
- Modern computer is built upon the foundations of the "model of computation" most commonly associated with the Turing Machine

Lambda vs. Machine
------------------
- General purpose programming languages are typically described as "Turing complete" <- they can emulate a Turing machine

Lambda vs. Machine
------------------
- In the 1930's model of computation Turing published the Turing Machine but *independently* Alonzo Church published the Lambda Calculus

Lambda vs. Machine
------------------
- Lambda Calculus is *equivalent* to the Turing Machine

Lambda vs. Machine
------------------
- Lambda Calculus is chosen as the starting point for *functional programming*
